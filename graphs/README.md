# Graphs

## Directed vs UnDirected Graph

#### Directed Graph

* Degree = no. edges from a graph
* Sum of degrees = 2 x \| no of edges \|
* max number of edge = \[ v \* \(v-1\) \]/2

#### Undirected Graph

* Degree = in-degree + out-degree 
* Sum of in-degree = \| no of edges \|
* Sum of out-degree = \| no of edges \|
* max number of edge = v \* \(v-1\)

## Concepts on graph

* Walk \( or Path \) : connection between connected edges
* Path \( or Simple Path \) : a walk without repeation

## Adjaceny Matrix vs List
